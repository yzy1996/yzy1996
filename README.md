ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) advised by [Qingfu Zhang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhang/). Before this, I obtained the bachelor degree in Automation at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

#### 1. How do you take notes?

I mainly use [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) for handwriting and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for digital writing.

#### 2. What `Markdown editor` do you use?

I mainly use [Typora](https://typora.io/), sometimes I would also use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with some extensions (e.g. Markdown All in One, Markdown+Math), and recently I find [Mathpix Markdown](https://mathpix.com/docs/mathpix-markdown/overview) is worth trying. I would use [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) when I need online collaboration.

#### 3. What `Latex editor` do you use?

I only use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and highly recommend. I also recommend subscribing a plan so that you can back up your files via Dropbox and access full History feature.

#### 4. Do you have some tips when using markdown/latex?

Here are some tools I often use: [Mathpix Snipping](https://mathpix.com/) - digitize handwritten or printed text into Latex; [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) - find the symbol you want by drawing; [PicGo](https://molunerfinn.com/PicGo/) - picture bed management.
